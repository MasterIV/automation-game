# The Lost World


## Setting
In a post apocalyptic world, earth is polluted and uninhabitable. Humans have been forced to live in bunkers deep under the ground, and send out androids to do the work of making earth inhabitable again. 

## Game Design

By either clicking a resource node or resources in a building inventory, they get transferred into the global inventory.

```
! The map should be tile-based, which simplifies path-finding. We could implement a simple a-star path-finding algo.
! Resources have to be sent to different different bunkers, that process the items into new items.
! Processing speed is influenced by surrounding tiles, some tiles add bonuses to some production, while removing from some.
! For this scope, we should start with a small amount of resources.
```
### Buildings

The player can place buildings on the map. 
Buildings might cost different resources that are consumed from the global inventory when placing the building.
A building can have the requirement to be build on a certain tzpe of terrain (for example resource node).

Each building can have a function. If we want to keep it simple this is a recipe:
 - input (optional, multiple)
 - processing time
 - output (maybe multiple but limiting on a single one might simplify things)
 
Each building has an inventory. The inventory has a certain amount of slots:
 - max capacity
 - type: input / output / storage
 
Examples:
 - Miner (different types might mine different resources)
 - Constructor:
   - one building per recipe 
   - a recipe selection in the building but have different types depending on recipe groups
   - different types of constructors depending on number of recipe inputs
 - Storage to create buffer

```
! Bunkers are static resource nodes. 
! Bunkers can be buildings. 
```
### Logistics

The function of logistics is to move items between buildings:
 - conveyor 
 - splitter (maybe merger)
 - intersection / tunnel (we need to implement a way for conveyors to cross)
 - teleportation ??? (not sure about this, might make it to easy)
 
For simplicity I would say each can only process one item at the time. 
But we can have versions with different speed (stretch goal :D).

We need to decide how logistics interact with buildings:
 - Do buildings have fixed input and output points?
 - Is only the output fixed and they accept from all directions? (this might be the easiest)
 - Do they output in any available direction and accept from any?

### Progression

Each milestone will require a certain number of items in the global inventory.
When all the resources are present, the milestone is completed and new unlocks (buildings or recipes) are granted.
Then the next milestone is automatically selected. If the last milestone is completed the player wins.

```
! Each milestone leads to the discovery of lost knowledge
```

### Electricity (stretch goal that we have to cut anyway)

Buildings need electricity to operate which has be produced by another type of building.
The building might need resources that are converted or just takes up space and is slow.
Electricity might have a simplified logistic system to be distributed across buildings.

```
Goals:
	Clean up air
	Clean up ground
	Clean up water
	Once everything is cleaned up, and first dwelling for humans is built = victory

Time:
	Real time animations but production only updates once every 100 ms.

Building priority setting:
	the building priority setting can be changed, once the highest priority buildings have received electricity, the next priority group gets electricity, and so on until it moves on until there is no more electricity.

Electricity buildings:
	solar power plant, desert, the more adjacent desert tiles, the more power
	solar power is available once the worst pollution is removed (milestone)

	hydroelectric power, river
	wind power, open field, the less objects in the vicinity, the more powerful
Electricity is universal, no wiring required.

	
Recipe:
Air pollution cleaners: drones that fly and clean the air ( if time allows, animate)
	require electric circuits + engines
IC Manufacturing plant:
	requires silicon + copper
Silicon mine: resource
Copper mine: Resource
```

## Work to do

- **Map:** we can either handcraft or generate one. Need to find a nice tile set
- **UI:** we have the following elements:
  - Build menu
  - Milestone display
  - Global inventory
  - Building details
  - Unlock notification
- **Game design:**
  - Items/Resources
  - Buildings
  - Recipes
  - Milestones
- **Game Elements:**
  - Logistics system
  - Buildings
